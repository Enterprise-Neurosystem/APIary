91.2 MB/min/chan (1.52 MBps/chan) raw data
76.8 kB/min/chan (1.28 kBps/chan) spectrum 1Hz resolution, 10bits amplitude, 1024Hz worth of 96kHz range.
3.84 kB/min/chan (64 Bps/chan) quantized into 256 bins, 2bits amplitude, all proportional to activity in full range of 96kHz. 
Roughly factor of 24k compression with quantization.

# Spectrograms

Quick spectrogram from Ryan Hive 2, Leo prototype microphone-0.  Seems the *information* dies out in the vicinity of 10 kHz.  Our ultrasonic hypothesis is very likely overkill.

Connect with Don DuRouseau (drdurous@uak.edu) regarding inducing a calm state in bees using the piezos as speakers in the hive.
Don was at GPN22 talking to me about brain waves and phase coherences.
Connect "the Dons"--DuRouseau and ALvarez--on the hive control.
